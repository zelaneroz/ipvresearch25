# NLP/LLM-Based Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) Detection

# Working Deliverable Journal
### Week 1 
Using open instruction-tuned models (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct & Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct), we experiment with prompting strategies for:
1. **Binary IPV Detection** → Classify sentences as `IPV` or `NOT_IPV`
2. **Type Detection** → Identify specific forms of IPV (Physical, Emotional, Sexual)
In `qwen1.ipynb` I compare an LLM's predictions with the DETECTIPV(2022) model, replicating the paper's metrics and pipeline for fair comparison.

**Task Breakdown**
* ~~Read the paper and identify the evaluation pipeilne~~
* Create `qwen2.ipynb` 
* Replicate the evaluation pipeline.


**Questions**
* 

**Next Steps**
* Sampling and evaluation on proprietary LLM like GPT-5
* Move to explore new dataset (unpublished; should be encrypt when kept in a public repository)
